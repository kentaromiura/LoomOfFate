Loom of fate
===

Loom of fate is an implementation of the Loom of fate + surge counter as described in https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/145426/CRGE-Conjectural-Roleplaying-GM-Emulator, from the late Zach Best .

It's meant as a GM emulator for playing solo-adventures, allowing one to play alone games that otherwise require at least 2 people .

If you want to learn more about solo roleplaying I suggest the subreddit
https://www.reddit.com/r/Solo_Roleplaying/ and the youtube series https://www.memyselfanddie.com/ .
